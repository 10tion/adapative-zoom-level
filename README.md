# adapative-zoom-level
A chrome (safari) extension which automatically sets page zoom level based on current display size (resolution).

Please note that this extension will not respect built-in per-site zoom settings. Adding that support will introduce unnecssary complexity which is out of my capacity. However, an ignore list may be added in the future to allow to exclude specific sites.

### Use on Safari
Follow the [instructions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_web_extensions/converting_a_web_extension_for_safari) for converting.

### Additional note
This is merely a variant of my another toy project [adaptive-user-agent-switcher](https://github.com/10tion/adaptive-user-agent-switcher). They share a lot of code (and bugs) :)
